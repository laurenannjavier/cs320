How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I start by implementing thorough testing practices. Writing comprehensive unit tests, as I did with ContactTest.java, is important for proving that each part of my program works as intended. Additionally, incorporating input validation within my code to handle data securely and prevent weaknesses, just like the validation I added to the Contact.java fields. As well as regularly reviewing my code through peer code review to catch potential mistakes.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs begins with effective requirements gathering for me. This involves communicating with users through interviews, surveys, or direct observation to understand their expectations and challenges. For my Contact.java project, this meant identifying the need for fields like firstName, lastName, and phone, and ensuring that these were implemented in a way that met user expectations. Once I have a clear understanding of the requirements, I prioritize them based on their impact and feasibility, and then design my program to address these needs directly.

How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I start by creating a clear and organized plan that outlines how my program will meet the identified user needs. This involves defining the architecture, selecting appropriate data structures, and planning the flow of data within the application. For example, in my Contact.java project, this meant deciding how to structure the contact information and what methods were needed to manipulate it. I also make sure to incorporate security and scalability considerations into my design from the start to ensure that my program remains strong and secure as it evolves.
